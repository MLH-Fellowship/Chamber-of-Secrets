# Chamber Of Secrets
---

Built on the principles of Ethical Data, Chamber of Secrets is a redefined Digital Locker system straight out of the magical Harry Potter universe created by J.K. Rowling. Inspired by the One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Lord Voldermort himself, we ensure that your data is accessible to you, and `only you`.

## Idea
---

The idea was to provide a secure storage option for users with the storage reliablity of current storage options like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive etc. Chamber of Secrets is a digital locker where the user can store their files. The file is encrypted and split into three parts (or Horcruxes) each of which are saved on different storage platforms like Google Drive and Dropbox.

## Features
---

- Allows users to upload their files, which are encrypted, split then stored on multiple storage platforms.
- Download your files, that can only be decrypted using the user's private key.
- Delete your files by just one click.
- Google Drive and Dropbox OAuth2 user authentication.
- Provides highly secure storage option using hybrid encryption and file splitting techniques.
